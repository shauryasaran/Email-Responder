# Email-Responder
Python script that creates a Flask web application that allows users to log in with their email address. Upon logging in, the user is redirected to the index page where they can provide an email and receive a response to that email generated by the OpenAI API. The user's email and the generated responses are stored in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. The code also includes functionality for user authentication, including login and logout routes.
